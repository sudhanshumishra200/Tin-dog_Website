# Tin-dog_Website
This is a basic front-end project. Bacically this is a dog matcher website. Through this website, you can find a friend for your dog. This is just like Tinder or Bumble.
This project is done by using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. We use HTML for templating the website and for style, we use the CSS library Bootstrap.
There is no backend in this project only frontend I will add backend soon.
